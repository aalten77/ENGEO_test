The Property is approximately <span class=""&quot;'EDRVariable&quot;""><span class=""EDRVariable PropertySize"">21,000</span><span class=""nbspcls"">&#160;square&#160;feet&#160;</span></span>in area and is identified by portions of Assessor's Parcel Numbers (APNs) <span class=""&quot;'EDRVariable&quot;""><span class=""EDRVariable APN"">116-110-007, 116-06-018, 116-11-031, 116-11-032, and 116-06-019</span></span>. <br /><br />The Property consists of a asphalt-paved elevated embankment which serves as a trailhead at Crittenden Lane for Stevens Creek Trail. Review of historical records indicates that the Property has remained a trailhead since at least 1939. Power transmission lines have traversed above the Property since at least 1961.&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>This assessment included a review of local, state, tribal, and federal environmental record sources, standard historical sources, aerial photographs, fire insurance maps, and physical setting sources. A reconnaissance of the Property was conducted to review site use and current conditions to check for the storage, use, production or disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous materials and interviews with persons knowledgeable about current and past site use.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>The site reconnaissance and records review did not find documentation or physical evidence of soil or groundwater impairments associated with the use or past use of the Property. A review of regulatory databases maintained by county, state, tribal, and federal agencies found no documentation of hazardous materials violations or discharge on the Property and did not identify contaminated facilities within the appropriate American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) search distances that would reasonably be expected to impact the Property.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Based on the findings of this assessment, no Recognized Environmental Conditions (RECs), no&#160;historical RECs, and no &#160;controlled RECs were identified for the Property.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>ENGEO has performed a phase I environmental site assessment in general conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM E1527-13 and the standards and practices of the All Appropriate Inquiry Final Rule (40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 312).</p><p>&#160;</p><p>It is our opinion that the findings of this study are based on a sufficient level of information obtained during our contracted scope of services to render a conclusion as to whether additional appropriate investigation is required to identify the presence or likely presence of a REC. The data gaps identified during this process do not affect the conclusions as to the presence or lack of presence of RECs at the Property. The following data gaps were identified:</p><p>&#160;</p><ul><li>We did not receive an updated Preliminary Title Report.</li><li>We did not receive a response from the City of Mountain View Fire Department.</li><li>We did not receive a Key Site Manager completed environmental questionnaire.</li></ul><p>&#160;</p><p>This assessment has revealed no evidence of Recognized Environmental Conditions in connection with the Property, and the Property is suitable for trail improvements as proposed. ENGEO recommends no further environmental studies at this time.</p>"
460a4594b6aa4b0c9b61c5056bd27ed6,PURPOSE OF PHASE I ENVIRONMENTAL SITE ASSESSMENT,"<p>This assessment was performed at the request of <span class=""EDRVariable ClientCompany"">BKF Engineers</span>&#160;for the purpose of responding to Mitigation Measure Haz-1 for the Crittenden Trailhead Project. The objective of this phase I environmental site assessment is to identify Recognized Environmental Conditions (RECs) associated with the Property. As defined in the ASTM Standard Practice E1527-13, an REC is &#8220;the presence or likely presence of any hazardous substances or petroleum products in, on, or at a property: (1) due to release to the environment; (2) under conditions indicative of a release to the environment; or (3) under conditions that pose a material threat of a future release to the environment.&#8221;</p>"
